## Hello.

I'm an incoming PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) of Purdue University, advised by [Professor Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I'm broadly interested in natural language processing and information retrieval.

My long-term research goal is to develop NLP methods that would enable systems for facilitating *more engaged exchanges* and *comprehensive presentations of opinions* over the Internet: I believe that such systems could assist us in building more equitable societies by encouraging deliberative conversations across diverse social groups. Moreover, they would provide various stakeholders with more accurate snapshots of relevant opinion landscapes, leading to more sound understanding and better decision-making. 

On this front, my recent research efforts have focused on leveraging **deep learning** to reliably capture **semantics and pragmatics** from the texts of *subjective nature*: not only inherently opinionated documents such as social media or online shopping reviews, but also the ones possessing potentially more subtle, complex subjectivity such as academic papers.

Some of my recent projects include:

* Open Aspect Target Sentiment Classification with Natural Language Prompts. **accepted to EMNLP 2021 main conference.** [paper](https://link.iamblogger.net/atscprompts-paper), [slides](https://link.iamblogger.net/atscprompts-slides), [poster](https://link.iamblogger.net/atscprompts-poster), [code](https://link.iamblogger.net/atscprompts).
* Multi-Facet Embeddings for Academic Paper Recommendation.

Before Purdue, I received a MS in Computer Science from the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During my time at UMass, I worked as a researcher in [Professor Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/)'s [Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL)](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/).

A while back, I completed an MSc in Operational Research from [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), where my dissertation advisor was [Professor László A. Végh](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/). I graduated with a BA in Computer Science and Business from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/).
