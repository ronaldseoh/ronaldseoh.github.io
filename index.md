## Hello.

I'm a graduate student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I also work as a research in [Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/), led by [Professor Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/). I'm broadly interested in natural language processing and information retrieval.

My long term research goal is to develop NLP methods that would enable systems for **facilitating more engaged exchanges and comprehensive views of opinions** over the internet: I believe that such systems could be a part of fundamental solutions to many imminent issues surrounding the social media today, notably misinformation, polarization, and algorithmic bias.

On that front, my current efforts focus on leveraging deep learning to reliably capture **semantics** and **mutifacetedness** from *the texts of subjective nature*: not only inherently opinionated documents such as social media or online shopping reviews, but also the ones possessing potentially more subtle, complex subjectivity such as academic papers.

Some of my recent projects include:

* [Open Aspect Target Sentiment Classification with Natural Language Prompts.](https://link.iamblogger.net/atscprompts-paper) **(accepted to EMNLP 2021 main conference!)**
* Multi-Facet Embeddings for Academic Paper Recommendation.
* Enforcing Consistency by Reasoning on Extracted Evidence.

In my previous life, I was an analyst for the Financial Engineering Division of [KIS Pricing Inc.](https://eng.bond.co.kr), a [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) subsidiary. I mainly worked on implementing and maintaining various internal tools for the company's equity derivatives pricing services.

I received an MSc in Operational Research from [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), where my dissertation advisor was [Professor László A. Végh](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/). I graduated with a BA in Computer Science and Business from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/).
