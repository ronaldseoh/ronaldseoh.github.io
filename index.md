## Hello.

I'm a graduate student in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with the current focus on natural language processing and information retrieval.

In my previous life, I was an analyst for the Financial Engineering Division of [KIS Pricing Inc.](https://eng.bond.co.kr), a [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) subsidiary. I mainly worked on implementing and maintaining various internal tools for the company's equity derivatives-related services.

I received an MSc in Operational Research from [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), where my dissertation advisor was [László A. Végh](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/). I graduated with a BA in Computer Science and Business from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/).
